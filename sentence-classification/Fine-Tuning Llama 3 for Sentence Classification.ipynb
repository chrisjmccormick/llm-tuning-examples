        "* This [blog post](https://www.striveworks.com/blog/llms-for-text-classification-a-guide-to-supervised-learning) by Benjamin Nativi, at the company StriveWorks, was a great resource for understanding and comparing some of the possible approaches to applying an LLM to classification. In particular, it's how I learned about the technique of using the LM head for the classification step. The post doesn't include code, but their research was a helpful starting point.\n",
